# Queue's Animal Adoption Agency

  The intent behind this project was to practice incorporating 
  a data structure (queue) into a  fullstack app.

  The cats and dogs are stored in queues on the server side, 
  and when an animal is 'adopted' on the client side, 
  it is removed (dequeued) using a First-In-First-Out order.

### Technologies Used
  
  The Queue Agency was a quick and dirty project.  
  It was built in one day by one person. 

  The server was built on Thinkful's boiler-plate repo using 
  Node.js and Express, while the Queue class was built earlier in the week.
  This project does not currently use a database.

  The client side utilized create-react-app, with the addition of 
  Redux, and a little CSS.
