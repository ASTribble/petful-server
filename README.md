# Queue's Animal Adoption Agency

  The intent behind this project was to practice incorporating a data structure (queue) into a  fullstack app.

  The cats and dogs are stored in queues on the server side, and when an animal is 'adopted' on the client side, that animal is removed (dequeued) using a First-In-First-Out order.

### Technologies Used
  
  The Queue Agency was a quick and dirty project.  It was built in one day by one person. 

  The server was built on Thinkful's boiler-plate repo using Node.js and Express.
  The Queue class implemented in the server was built earlier in the week.

  The client side utilized create-react-app, with the addition of Redux, and a little CSS.

### Deployment and Repos

  - The client repository is on github at: https://github.com/ASTribble/petful-client

  - The server repository is also on github: https://github.com/ASTribble/petful-server

  - There's not much to see here, but the server is deployed on Heroku: https://scott-petful.herokuapp.com/
